Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
Each one she passes goes aah
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle
That when she passes
Each one she passes goes hmm
Ohh, but I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her, I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall, tan, young, lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see
Ohh, but I watch her so sadly, how can I tell her, I love her
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan, young and lonely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes
I smile but she doesn't see, she ain't lookin' at me
It ain't me that she sees
She keeps walkin' and swingin', on the beach you see
But she's walkin' down the beach
She swings like a samba
