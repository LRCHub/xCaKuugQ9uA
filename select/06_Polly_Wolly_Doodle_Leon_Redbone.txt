Well I went down South for to see my gal
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day
She got curly eyes, laughing hair
Polly Wolly Doodle all day
Fare thee well, fare thee well, Fare thee well my fairy fay
I'm going to Lou'siana for to see my Susianna
Polly wolly doodle all the day

There's a grasshopper sitting on a railroad track
Polly Wolly Doodle all day
Picking his teeth with a carpet tack
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day

Fare thee well, fare thee well, Fare thee well my fairy fay
I'm going to Lou'siana for to see my Susianna
Polly wolly doodle all the day
I went to a river, couldn't get across
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day
I Jumped on a 'gator, I thought it was a horse
Polly Wolly Doodle all the day

Fare thee well, fare thee well, Fare thee well my fairy fay
I'm going to Lou'siana for to see my Susianna
Polly wolly doodle all the day

I'm going to Lou'siana for to see my Susianna
Polly wolly doodle all the day
I'm going to Lou'siana for to see my Susianna
Polly wolly doodle all the day
Polly wolly doodle all the day
Polly wolly doodle all the day
Polly wolly doodle all the day
