Can you see me?
Can you hear me?
Dig if you will the picture

You and I engaged in a kiss
I love you
And once more, I want you
Do you want me?

I'd love to take you to my house
It's a purple house
Would you like to go?
I'll take you, but you have to promise me one thing
And that is, that you'll stay with me forever

I love you
I love you so very much
And yet
I can't, I can't

Oh my darling close your eyes
And try to imagine
As the rain begins to fall
Seventeen days

Yes, I love you
I knew it the moment I laid eyes on you
And yet
I can't, something
Close your eyes and imagine the rain
Falls fast and fast and fast and fast

Do you believe in love?
Do you believe in lust?
